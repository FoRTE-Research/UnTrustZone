      <h3> Introduction [Work in progress]</h3>  
      At a high-leve, UntrustZone is a sophisticated attack that unveils on-chip secrets stored within Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) by exploiting the long-term data remanence effect. This method illustrates how an adversary can meticulously read data from a secure memory area, even when hardware-backed security enclaves, such as TrustZone, are rigorously enforced. By revealing the vulnerability in contemporary security measures, UntrustZone underscores the need for more robust defenses against potential physical breaches.
